# Music generation with artificial neural networks
### Group project: Advanced topics in machine learning lecture
Participants: Benjamin Ellenberger, Nicolas Deperrois, Laura Kriener

### Project description
We plan to attempt the generation of music with different flavors of neural
networks encountered throughout the lecture.
This will allow us to compare and evaluate the strenghs and weaknesses of the
different network kinds for this task.

#### Data sets
We plan to use midi data for this task. Possible sources for the data can be
found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/3ajwe4/the_largest_midi_collection_on_the_internet/)
